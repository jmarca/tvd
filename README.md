# tvd, testbed vds detectors

This is the code to copy detector information from spatialvds database
to some other database.

Or maybe it actually will include the raw metadata.  Not sure yet.

Definitely it will include the table definition stuff.


# create the tvd stuff

I need to create tvd from spatialvds, then dump to a file or use
pgdump pipe psql thing

But I need to make sure that either a table exists or a view

Will a view work?
